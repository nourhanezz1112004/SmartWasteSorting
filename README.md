# Smart Waste Sorting System using Computer Vision

## Project Idea
**Description:**  
The *Smart Waste Sorting System* is an AI-based application that uses computer vision to automatically classify waste materials (e.g., plastic, paper, metal, glass, organic). This project aims to promote sustainable waste management by helping users or organizations separate waste efficiently. Target users include recycling centers, universities, and smart cities. The expected outcome is an accurate, real-time waste classification model that assists in environmental conservation.

**Objectives:**
- Develop a computer vision model capable of classifying different waste types using images.  
- Integrate the model with a simple interface or camera feed for real-time detection.  
- Evaluate and optimize model accuracy and efficiency.  
- Raise awareness about environmental sustainability through technology.

**Scope:**  
**In Scope:** Image data collection, preprocessing, CNN model training, evaluation, and demo visualization.  
**Out of Scope:** Physical robotic implementation or hardware sorting mechanisms.
