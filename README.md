# Smart Waste Sorting System (Python GUI Simulation)

## Project Idea

**Description:**
The *Smart Waste Sorting System (Python GUI Simulation)* is a software-based project that simulates how smart waste sorting works — without hardware.
It uses Python logic and a graphical user interface (GUI) to classify user-input items (like “bottle”, “banana peel”, “can”) into categories such as plastic, metal, organic, or paper.
The project aims to raise awareness about automated waste management while demonstrating fundamental AI-inspired decision systems.
Target users include students, environmental researchers, and smart city education programs.
Expected outcomes include a clean, interactive interface and accurate text-based waste classification.

**Objectives:**

* Design a simple, interactive GUI using Python only (no hardware).
* Implement a logic-based waste classifier that detects item type from user input.
* Display real-time feedback through the interface.
* Educate users on proper waste segregation.

**Scope:**
**In Scope:** GUI design, logic-based classification, educational demo, and documentation.
**Out of Scope:** Any physical hardware, camera input, or machine learning integration.
